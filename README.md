[![Mentioned in Awesome Go](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go)

Full-featured and highly configurable event-driven file transfer solution.
Server protocols: SFTP, HTTP/S, FTP/S, WebDAV.
Storage backends: local filesystem, encrypted local filesystem, S3 (compatible) Object Storage, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, other SFTP servers.

With SFTPGo you can leverage local and cloud storage backends for exchanging and storing files internally or with business partners using the same tools and processes you are already familiar with.

The WebAdmin UI allows to easily create and manage your users, folders, groups and other resources.

The WebClient UI allows end users to change their credentials, browse and manage their files in the browser and setup two-factor authentication which works with Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator, Authy and other compatible apps.

## Sponsors

We strongly believe in Open Source software model, so we decided to make SFTPGo available to everyone, but maintaining and evolving SFTPGo takes a lot of time and work. To make development and maintenance sustainable you should consider to support the project with a [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/drakkan).

We love doing the work and we'd like to keep doing it - your support helps make SFTPGo possible.

It is important to understand that you should support SFTPGo and any other Open Source project you rely on for ongoing maintenance, even if you don't have any questions or need new features, to mitigate the business risk of a project you depend on going unmaintained, with its security and development velocity implications.
