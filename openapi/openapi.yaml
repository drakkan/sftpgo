  title: SFTPGo
  description: |
    SFTPGo allows to securely share your files over SFTP, HTTP and optionally FTP/S and WebDAV as well.
    Several storage backends are supported and they are configurable per user, so you can serve a local directory for a user and an S3 bucket (or part of it) for another one.
    SFTPGo also supports virtual folders, a virtual folder can use any of the supported storage backends. So you can have, for example, an S3 user that exposes a GCS bucket (or part of it) on a specified path and an encrypted local filesystem on another one.
    Virtual folders can be private or shared among multiple users, for shared virtual folders you can define different quota limits for each user.
    SFTPGo allows to create HTTP/S links to externally share files and folders securely, by setting limits to the number of downloads/uploads, protecting the share with a password, limiting access by source IP address, setting an automatic expiration date.

      description: 'API key to use for authentication. API key authentication is intrinsically less secure than using a short lived JWT token. You should prefer API key authentication only for machine-to-machine communications in trusted environments. If no admin/user is associated to the provided key you need to add ".username" at the end of the key. For example if your API key is "6ajKLwswLccVBGpZGv596G.ySAXc8vtp9hMiwAuaLtzof" and you want to impersonate the admin with username "myadmin" you have to use "6ajKLwswLccVBGpZGv596G.ySAXc8vtp9hMiwAuaLtzof.myadmin" as API key. When using API key authentication you cannot manage API keys, update the impersonated admin, change password or public keys for the impersonated user.'
